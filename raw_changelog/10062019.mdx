# Included new fields

We have introduced two new fields, last\_traded\_at and last\_fetched\_at, to the ticker data. 

The existing timestamp field, which currently reflects the last\_traded\_at value, will be retained for compatibility. 

However, please be advised that the timestamp field may be deprecated in the future. 

We recommend updating your application to make use of the newly added last\_traded\_at and last\_fetched\_at fields for improved accuracy and compatibility.
