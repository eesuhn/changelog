# New Megafilter Endpoint,  200+ Chains Supported: Hyperliquid, Abstract, Berachain & MOAR!

## ðŸ‘€ What Can You Do?

With the /megafilter endpoint, you can slice and dice on-chain data your way across:

* 200+ blockchain networks, 1,400+ dexes, 6M+ pools, and 5M+ tokens
* Advanced filtering options based on liquidity, FDV, volume, transactions, buy/sell trends, and time range

Here's some quick examples:
