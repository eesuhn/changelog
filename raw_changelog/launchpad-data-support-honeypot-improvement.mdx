# Now Supported: Launchpad Data (Pump.fun & More), Granular OHLCV, and Honeypot Info

We're excited to announce a major update to our on-chain API endpoints! This release introduces support for popular token launchpads, adds high-frequency OHLCV data, and enhances our honeypot detection capabilities to give you deeper and more timely on-chain insights.

## üöÄ Now Supporting Launchpad Data (Pump.fun & More!)

In addition to the 1,600+ DEXes already integrated with GeckoTerminal.com, you can now track token data from popular launchpad platforms directly through the CoinGecko API. More launchpads will be supported soon!

**New Supported Launchpads:**

| Launchpad                                                                                       | network id (API) | dex id (API)      |
| :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------- | :---------------- |
| [Meteora DBC](https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/meteora-dbc/pools)                           | solana           | meteora-dbc       |
| [Pump.fun](https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/pump-fun/pools)                                 | solana           | pump-fun          |
| [Raydium Launchpad](https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/raydium-launchlab/pools) (LetsBonkFun) | solana           | raydium-launchlab |
| [Boop.fun](https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/boop-fun/pools)                                 | solana           | boop-fun          |
| [Virtuals (Base)](https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/virtuals-base/pools)                       | base             | virtuals-base     |

**Improved endpoints to track launchpad data:**

* [Token Data by Token Address](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/token-data-contract-address)
* [Tokens Data by Token Addresses](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/tokens-data-contract-addresses)
* [Specific Pool Data by Pool Address](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/pool-address)
* [Multiple Pools Data by Pool Addresses](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/pools-addresses)

More launchpad-specific data will be supported soon for the endpoints above!

**Tips:** use [megafilter endpoint](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/pools-megafilter) to retrieve latest launchpad data, by flagging `sort=pool_created_at_desc`

**Request example** (Get latest pools on Pump.fun):

```curl
https://pro-api.coingecko.com/api/v3/onchain/pools/megafilter?page=1&networks=solana&dexes=pump-fun&sort=pool_created_at_desc&x_cg_pro_api_key=YOUR_KEY
```

## [Pro-API Exclusive] More Granular OHLCV Data

On-chain OHLCV endpoints now support higher frequency intervals, down to 1-second granularity.

| Timeframe | Aggregate (Before) | Aggregate (New) |
| :-------- | :----------------- | :-------------- |
| day       | 1                  | 1               |
| hour      | 1, 4, 12           | 1, 4, 12        |
| minute    | 1, 5, 15           | 1, 5, 15        |
| second    | n/a                | 1, 15, 30       |

**Improved Endpoints:**

* [Pool OHLCV chart by Pool Address](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/pool-ohlcv-contract-address)
* [Token OHLCV chart by Token Address](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/token-ohlcv-token-address)

**New interval supported:**

* 1s
* 15s
* 30s

**Example Request (Get the last 100 1-second intervals for a pool on Ethereum):**

```curl
https://pro-api.coingecko.com/api/v3/onchain/networks/eth/pools/0x06da0fd433c1a5d7a4faa01111c044910a184553/ohlcv/second?aggregate=1&limit=100&include_empty_intervals=false&x_cg_pro_api_key=YOUR_KEY
```

## üçØ Enhanced Honeypot Information

We've expanded our honeypot detection features to provide more comprehensive risk assessment. You can now check if a token is a potential honeypot using the main info endpoints.

**Improved Endpoints:**

* [Token Info by Token Address](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/token-info-contract-address)
* [Pool Tokens Info by Pool Address](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/pool-token-info-contract-address)

**Example Payload:**

```json
{
 "mint_authority": null,
 "freeze_authority": null,
 "is_honeypot": true  // possible values: true / false / unknown
}
```

## [Pro-API Exclusive] New Filtering Option in Megafilter

Previously, the[Pools Megafilter](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/pools-megafilter) endpoint could only show tokens confirmed as ***not*** a honeypot (`checks=no_honeypot`). Now, you can also include tokens where the honeypot status is 'unknown'.

* To use this, set `include_unknown_honeypot_tokens=true`.
* Important: This parameter only takes effect when `checks=no_honeypot` is also specified in the request.

**Example Request (Get trending pools that are not confirmed honeypots, including those with an unknown status):**

```curl
https://pro-api.coingecko.com/api/v3/onchain/pools/megafilter?page=1&sort=h6_trending&checks=no_honeypot&include_unknown_honeypot_tokens=true&x_cg_pro_api_key=YOUR_KEY
```

## üìà Expanded Pool Data

**Endpoint**: [Pool Tokens Info by Pool Address](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/pool-token-info-contract-address)

By adding `include=pool` to your request on the pool tokens endpoint, you can now retrieve additional context about the pool itself.

* Base and quote token address
* Sentiment vote percentage (positive and negative)
* Community suspicious reports count

**Payload Example**:

```json
  "included": [
    {
      "id": "eth_0x06da0fd433c1a5d7a4faa01111c044910a184553",
      "type": "pool",
      "attributes": {
        "base_token_address": "0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7",
        "quote_token_address": "0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2",
        "sentiment_vote_positive_percentage": 100,
        "sentiment_vote_negative_percentage": 0,
        "community_sus_report": 0
      }
    }
  ]
```
