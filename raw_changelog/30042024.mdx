# Added support for inactive coins in /coins/list and historical data endpoints

We've now enhanced the [/coins/list](/reference/coins-list) endpoint to include inactive coins

* You may access the inactive coins by specifying `status=inactive` in your query
* Example of endpoint request:\
  `https://pro-api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/list?include_platform=false&status=inactive&x_cg_pro_api_key=YOUR_API_KEY`

Additionally, historical data for inactive coins can be queried using their IDs in the following endpoints:

* [/coins/\{id}/history](/reference/coins-id-history)
* [/coins/\{id}/market\_chart](/reference/coins-id-market-chart)
* [/coins/\{id}/market\_chart/range](/reference/coins-id-market-chart-range)
* [/coins/\{id}/contract/\{contract\_address}/market\_chart](/reference/contract-address-market-chart)
* [/coins/\{id}/contract/\{contract\_address}/market\_chart/range](/reference/contract-address-market-chart-range)

Please note that these features are available exclusively for **paid plan subscribers only**
