## Onchain Trades: Added Token Filter

**Endpoint:** [Past 24 Hour Trades by Pool Address](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/pool-trades-contract-address)

**Previously:** There was no way to filter trades data by base or quote token.

**Now**: A new optional parameter has been added to allow filtering by base or quote token of a pool.

* Parameter: `token`
* Value options:
  * `base`
  * `quote`
  * `{token_address}`

**Example**:

```json Example
?token=base // get the trades data of base token
?token=quote // get the trades data of quote token
?token=8FqXr6dw5NHA2TtwFeDz6q9p7y9uWyoEdZmpXqqUpump // get the trades data of specific token based on address
```
