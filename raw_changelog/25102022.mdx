# Introduced new endpoints and improvements

We've added new [/global/market_cap_chart](/reference/global-market-cap-chart) endpoint for Paid Plan Subscribers. This allows users to query historical market cap chart data. 

We've introduced a filter param, currently limited to "nft," to the [/asset_platforms](/reference/asset-platforms-list) endpoint. This allows users to obtain a comprehensive list of NFT blockchain networks supported by CoinGecko.

A new parameter, "precision," has been added to the [/simple/price](/reference/simple-price) endpoint. This enhancement allows users to customize the returned coin price based on the specified number of decimals or retrieve it with full decimal precision.
