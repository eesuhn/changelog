# Introduced new historical total supply endpoints

We've introduced Historical Total Supply data to Enterprise plan subscribers via these 2 exclusive endpoints:

* [/coins/{id}/total_supply_chart](/reference/coins-id-total-supply-chart) : get historical total supply of a coin, by number of days away from now.
* [/coins/{id}/total_supply_chart/range](/reference/coins-id-total-supply-chart-range) : get historical total supply of a coin, within a range of timestamp.
