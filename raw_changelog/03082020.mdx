# Introduced category filter params to /coins/markets

We've implemented a category filter, currently limited to "decentralized\_finance\_defi," for the [/coins/markets](/reference/coins-markets) endpoint. 

This addition allows users to filter and retrieve market data specifically related to decentralized finance (DeFi) within the endpoint.
