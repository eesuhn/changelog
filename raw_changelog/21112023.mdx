# Multiple Improvements

The web_slug data is now available in the following endpoints.

* [/coins/{id}](/reference/coins-id)
* [/coins/{contract}/contract/{contract_address}](/reference/coins-contract-address)

This addition allows users to accurately link to a CoinGecko coin page using [www.coingecko.com/en/{web_slug}](http://www.coingecko.com/en/{web_slug}).

**Example of responses:**

```Text JSON
{
  "id": "bitcoin",
  "symbol": "btc",
  "name": "Bitcoin",
  "web_slug": "bitcoin", ðŸ‘ˆ
  ......
  "tickers": [...]
}
```

For the [/asset_platforms](/reference/asset-platforms-list) endpoint, we've introduced the native_coin_id data. This enables users to obtain the coin ID of different blockchain networks or asset platforms that may not have a contract address to look up

**Example of responses:**

```Text JSON
{
  "id": "polygon-pos",
  "chain_identifier": 137,
  "name": "Polygon POS",
  "shortname": "MATIC", 
  "native_coin_id": "matic-network" ðŸ‘ˆ
},
```
