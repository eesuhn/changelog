This new [Categories List](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/categories-list) endpoint allows you to query all the categories supported on GeckoTerminal.com such as 'Pump Fun' and 'Animal'.  

* This endpoint is exclusively available for [Analyst/Lite/Pro/Enterprise plan](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/pricing) subscribers only. 

## NEW: Onchain Catergory Pools: Get Pools of a specific Category

This new [Pools by Category ID](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/pools-category) endpoint allows you to query all the pools of a specific category on GeckoTerminal.com.

## Onchain Token Info: Added Categories Data

You can now obtain the categories of a token via the following endpoints: 

1. [Token Info by Token Address](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/token-info-contract-address)
2. [Pool Tokens Info by Pool Address](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/pool-token-info-contract-address)

Payload example:

```yaml json

    "Doge",
    "Baby",
    "Animal"
  ],

```

## Onchain New Pools Data: Bug Fixed

Previously, this [/networks/new_pools](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/latest-pools-network) endpoint omitted new pools that are created within the last 24 hours. 

It now returns all newly created pools in the last 48 hours.

You now query the the list of id of delisted exchanges with [Exchanges List (ID Map)](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/exchanges-list) endpoint, by flagging `status=inactive `

    "name": "FTX"
  },
  {
    "id": "ftx_tr",
    "name": "FTX TR"
