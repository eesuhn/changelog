# Introduced /networks/{network}/pools/{pool_address}/trades endpoint (Onchain/GT)

You can now get the latest 300 trades in the past 24 hours of a given pool from this endpoint [/networks/\{network}/pools/\{pool\_address}/trades](/reference/pool-trades-contract-address). You may optionally filter by trade size as well. You can now build your own telegram bot alert!
