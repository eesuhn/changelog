# Upcoming Change Notice: Removal of twitter_followers Data

**Notice: Upcoming Change to CoinGecko API Endpoints - Removal of`twitter_followers` Data**

**Effective Date: 15 May 2025**

**Affected Endpoints:**

* [Coin Data by Token Address](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/coins-contract-address)

**Details of the Change:**

Please be advised that the `twitter_followers` data point within the `community_data` object will be removed from the above-listed API endpoints, effective 15 May 2025. This change is being implemented due to significant recent changes to the X (formerly Twitter) API, which have fundamentally altered how this specific data can be accessed.

Example of Affected Data Structure:

```json
"community_data": {  
  "twitter_followers": 7694251,
  // ... other community data points ...
}
```

After the effective date, the `twitter_followers` field will no longer be present in the API responses for these endpoints.

**Action Required:**

If your applications or integrations currently rely on the `twitter_followers` data from these CoinGecko API endpoints, please make the necessary adjustments to your code before 15 May 2025 to avoid potential errors or data discrepancies.

**Important Note Regarding Previously Stored`twitter_followers` Data:**

Please be aware that if you have previously stored `twitter_followers` data obtained from the CoinGecko API and archived it within your own systems, you are solely responsible for its continued use and any implications thereof.

We appreciate your understanding as we adapt to changes in third-party platforms to maintain the stability and reliability of our API. If you have any questions or require further clarification, please do not hesitate to contact our support team.
