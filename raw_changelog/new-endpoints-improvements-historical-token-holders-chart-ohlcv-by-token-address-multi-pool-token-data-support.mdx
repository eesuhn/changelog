## [Pro-API Exclusive] New Endpoint  - Token OHLCV chart by Token Address

This endpoint allows you to get the OHLCV chart (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) of a token based on the provided token address on a network.

* This endpoint will return OHLCV data of the most liquid pool of the specified token. You may use this endpoint Top Pools by Token Address to check the top pools of a token.

## Improved Endpoints - Support Multi-pool Token Data

Previously, we only surfaced 1 quote token for pools with more than 2 tokens.  With this new improvements, for pools that have 2 or more tokens:

* Extra quote tokens being listed under a new key `relationships.quote_tokens`
* If `include=quote_token` is flagged, the extra quote tokens will be also listed under `included`

```json
    "relationships": {  
      "base_token": {
        "data": {
          "id": "eth_0x40d16fc0246ad3160ccc09b8d0d3a2cd28ae6c2f",
          "type": "token"
        }
      },
      "quote_token": {
        "data": {
          "id": "eth_0x8353157092ed8be69a9df8f95af097bbf33cb2af",
          "type": "token"
        }
      },
      "quote_tokens": {
        "data": [
          {
            "id": "eth_0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48",
            "type": "token"
          },
          {
            "id": "eth_0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7",
            "type": "token"
          }
```
