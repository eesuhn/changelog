# Set default params value for /coins/markets

To minimize bandwidth usage, the [/coins/markets](/reference/coins-markets) endpoint will now automatically default to retrieving data for the top 100 coins by market cap when the 'ids' parameter is left blank. 

This implies that the Order parameters will automatically default to `market_cap_desc`, ensuring a descending order based on market cap. The `Per_Page` parameters will default to 100, optimizing the response by providing data for the 100 results of coins per page if no coin's ids are mentioned.

This enhancement aims to streamline the user experience while conserving bandwidth resources.
