## Onchain Simple Token Price endpoint - Market Cap to FDV Fallback

The [Onchain Simple Token Price](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/onchain-simple-price) endpoint now supports fallback option for Market Cap to return FDV value, when the Market Cap value is not available. 

Notes:

* If the token's market cap is not verified by the CoinGecko team, the onchain endpoints will return **null** for its market cap value, even though it has a displayed value on GeckoTerminal, which might not be accurate as it often matches the Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV).
* Market Cap can be verified by and sourced from CoinGecko, and the number may be higher than FDV as it may include Market Cap of tokens issued on other blockchain network.

If you require the Market Cap key (`market_cap_usd`) to return FDV value (as seen on GeckoTerminal.com) when Market Cap data is unavailable, please specify this parameter `marketcap_fdv_fallback=true`.
