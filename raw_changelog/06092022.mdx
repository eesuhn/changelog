# Included new fields to multiple endpoints

We have added a new field, "details_platform," to the [/coins/{id}](/reference/coins-id) and [/coins/{asset_platform_id}/contract/{contract_address}](/reference/coins-contract-address) endpoints responses. 

The field contains information about the asset platform, specifically the "decimal_places," providing details on the decimal places associated with the asset platform.
