### Reason for Removal

Many of these categories no longer have associated coins. Some categories are outdated and no longer relevant in the crypto space. The changes align with updated category topology standards to maintain data accuracy and relevance.

### Impact

API responses for the `/coins/markets` [endpoint](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/coins-markets) will no longer support data of the categories above. Any requests specifying these categories will return an error.

### Action Required

Ensure applications using the `/coins/markets` [endpoint](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/coins-markets) are not querying these removed categories. Please update any code or documentation referencing these categories to prevent errors.
