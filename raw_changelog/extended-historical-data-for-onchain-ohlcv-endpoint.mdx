# Extended Historical Data for Onchain OHLCV Endpoint

## What's New?

We've improved the [Pool OHLCV Chart by Pool Address](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/pool-ohlcv-contract-address) endpoint to provide access to a much broader range of historical data.

### Key Updates

* **Previous Behavior:** Users could only query data for the past 6 months from today.
* **New Behavior**: Users can now access data from September 2021 to the present, depending on the pool's tracking start date on GeckoTerminal.
* Each API request is **limited to a 6-month date range**, but users can query older data by using the before\_timestamp parameter.

Note: access to data beyond the past 6 months is only available to [Paid Plan](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/pricing) subscribers (Analyst plan & above).

### Action Required

No changes are required for existing integrations. However, users who need data beyond the past 6 months should adjust their queries to use the `before_timestamp` parameter to fetch additional data.
