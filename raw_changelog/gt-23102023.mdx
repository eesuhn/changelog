# Introduced new endpoints (Onchain/GT)

You can now fetch token information such as name, image, social links, and description via these endpoints:

* To fetch information of tokens inside a pool, use [/networks/\{network}/pools/\{pool\_address}/info](/reference/pool-token-info-contract-address)
* To fetch information of a specific token use [/networks/\{network}/tokens/\{address}/info](/reference/token-info-contract-address)
* If you like to get token information of the most recently updated tokens, use [/tokens/info\_recently\_updated](/reference/tokens-info-recent-updated)
