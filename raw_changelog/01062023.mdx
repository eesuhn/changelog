# Multiple Improvements

We've made enhancements to the /search/trending and /coins/{asset_platform_id}/contract/{contract_address} endpoints:

* Top 5 trending NFT data (based on high trading volume in the last 24 hours) is now included in the [/search/trending](/reference/trending-search) endpoint
* Near Protocol contract address (e.g. wrap.near) is now supported for [/coins/{asset_platform_id}/contract/{contract_address} ](/reference/coins-contract-address) endpoint
