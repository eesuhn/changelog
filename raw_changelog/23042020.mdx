# Included new fields to /coins/markets

We've introduced three new fields atl, atl_change_percentage, and atl_date to the responses of [/coins/markets](/reference/coins-markets) endpoint. 

These additions provide valuable data on the all-time low (atl) price, percentage change since the all-time low, and the date of the all-time low for improved analysis and insights. 

**Example of responses:**
