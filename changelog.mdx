  ## Improved Update Frequency for selected Pro-API On-chain Endpoints

  üóìÔ∏è **August 18, 2025**

  [Changes below are applicable to all [paid plan subscribers](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/pricing).]

  Dear CoinGecko API paid plan subscribers,

  We're excited to announce an improvement to our API, aimed at providing you with even faster access to real-time data! Starting **02:00 UTC, September 2, 2025**, the edge cache duration for the following endpoints will be reduced from **30s **to **10s**, allowing you to retrieve updated data more frequently.

  | Endpoints                                                                                                    | Effective Date & Time                   | Current Update Frequency | New Update Frequency |

  #### **What This Means for You:**

  * **Fresher Data, Quicker**: With a reduced cache time, you'll now have the option to access more up-to-date data, closer to real-time!
  * **No Extra Credits for Cached Data**: If your request hits the cache (now updated every 10 seconds for endpoints above), there will be no additional credits charged - just like before.

  **Things to Keep in Mind:**

  * If your request hits our origin server instead of the cache to retrieve the latest data, there may be additional credits used.
  * To balance cost and real-time data needs, we recommend reviewing your request frequency. For those who prefer to obtain data without extra credits, consider keeping your request interval at 30 seconds or more to align with the new cache duration.

  We're committed to continuously improving your experience and ensuring you get the data you need, as efficiently as possible. If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out to [soonaik@coingecko.com](mailto:soonaik@coingecko.com) .

  ## Now Supported: Launchpad Data (Pump.fun & More), Granular OHLCV, and Honeypot Info

  üóìÔ∏è **August 05, 2025**

  We're excited to announce a major update to our on-chain API endpoints! This release introduces support for popular token launchpads, adds high-frequency OHLCV data, and enhances our honeypot detection capabilities to give you deeper and more timely on-chain insights.

  ### üöÄ Now Supporting Launchpad Data (Pump.fun & More!)

  In addition to the 1,600+ DEXes already integrated with GeckoTerminal.com, you can now track token data from popular launchpad platforms directly through the CoinGecko API. More launchpads will be supported soon!

  **New Supported Launchpads:**

  | Launchpad                                                                                       | network id (API) | dex id (API)      |
  | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------- | :---------------- |
  | [Meteora DBC](https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/meteora-dbc/pools)                           | solana           | meteora-dbc       |
  | [Pump.fun](https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/pump-fun/pools)                                 | solana           | pump-fun          |
  | [Raydium Launchpad](https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/raydium-launchlab/pools) (LetsBonkFun) | solana           | raydium-launchlab |
  | [Boop.fun](https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/boop-fun/pools)                                 | solana           | boop-fun          |
  | [Virtuals (Base)](https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/virtuals-base/pools)                       | base             | virtuals-base     |

  **Improved endpoints to track launchpad data:**

  * [Token Data by Token Address](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/token-data-contract-address)
  * [Tokens Data by Token Addresses](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/tokens-data-contract-addresses)
  * [Specific Pool Data by Pool Address](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/pool-address)
  * [Multiple Pools Data by Pool Addresses](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/pools-addresses)

  More launchpad-specific data will be supported soon for the endpoints above!

  **Tips:** use [megafilter endpoint](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/pools-megafilter) to retrieve latest launchpad data, by flagging `sort=pool_created_at_desc`

  **Request example** (Get latest pools on Pump.fun):

  ```curl
  https://pro-api.coingecko.com/api/v3/onchain/pools/megafilter?page=1&networks=solana&dexes=pump-fun&sort=pool_created_at_desc&x_cg_pro_api_key=YOUR_KEY
  ```

  ### [Pro-API Exclusive] More Granular OHLCV Data

  On-chain OHLCV endpoints now support higher frequency intervals, down to 1-second granularity.

  | Timeframe | Aggregate (Before) | Aggregate (New) |
  | :-------- | :----------------- | :-------------- |
  | day       | 1                  | 1               |
  | hour      | 1, 4, 12           | 1, 4, 12        |
  | minute    | 1, 5, 15           | 1, 5, 15        |
  | second    | n/a                | 1, 15, 30       |

  **Improved Endpoints:**

  * [Pool OHLCV chart by Pool Address](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/pool-ohlcv-contract-address)
  * [Token OHLCV chart by Token Address](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/token-ohlcv-token-address)

  **New interval supported:**

  * 1s
  * 15s
  * 30s

  **Example Request (Get the last 100 1-second intervals for a pool on Ethereum):**

  ```curl
  https://pro-api.coingecko.com/api/v3/onchain/networks/eth/pools/0x06da0fd433c1a5d7a4faa01111c044910a184553/ohlcv/second?aggregate=1&limit=100&include_empty_intervals=false&x_cg_pro_api_key=YOUR_KEY
  ```

  ### üçØ Enhanced Honeypot Information

  We've expanded our honeypot detection features to provide more comprehensive risk assessment. You can now check if a token is a potential honeypot using the main info endpoints.

  **Improved Endpoints:**

  * [Token Info by Token Address](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/token-info-contract-address)
  * [Pool Tokens Info by Pool Address](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/pool-token-info-contract-address)

  **Example Payload:**

  ```json
  {
   "mint_authority": null,
   "freeze_authority": null,
   "is_honeypot": true  // possible values: true / false / unknown
  }
  ```

  ### [Pro-API Exclusive] New Filtering Option in Megafilter

  Previously, the[Pools Megafilter](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/pools-megafilter) endpoint could only show tokens confirmed as ***not*** a honeypot (`checks=no_honeypot`). Now, you can also include tokens where the honeypot status is 'unknown'.

  * To use this, set `include_unknown_honeypot_tokens=true`.
  * Important: This parameter only takes effect when `checks=no_honeypot` is also specified in the request.

  **Example Request (Get trending pools that are not confirmed honeypots, including those with an unknown status):**

  ```curl
  https://pro-api.coingecko.com/api/v3/onchain/pools/megafilter?page=1&sort=h6_trending&checks=no_honeypot&include_unknown_honeypot_tokens=true&x_cg_pro_api_key=YOUR_KEY
  ```

  ### üìà Expanded Pool Data

  **Endpoint**: [Pool Tokens Info by Pool Address](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/pool-token-info-contract-address)

  By adding `include=pool` to your request on the pool tokens endpoint, you can now retrieve additional context about the pool itself.

  * Base and quote token address
  * Sentiment vote percentage (positive and negative)
  * Community suspicious reports count

  **Payload Example**:

  ```json
    "included": [
      {
        "id": "eth_0x06da0fd433c1a5d7a4faa01111c044910a184553",
        "type": "pool",
        "attributes": {
          "base_token_address": "0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7",
          "quote_token_address": "0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2",
          "sentiment_vote_positive_percentage": 100,
          "sentiment_vote_negative_percentage": 0,
          "community_sus_report": 0
        }
      }
    ]
  ```

  ## New Endpoints & Improvements: Historical Token Holders Chart, OHLCV by Token Address, Multi-pool Token Data Support

  üóìÔ∏è **June 09, 2025**

  ### [Pro-API Exclusive] New Endpoint  - Historical Token Holders Chart by Token Address

  This new endpoint allows you to get the historical token holders chart based on the provided token contract address on a network.

  * Supported chains include: Solana, EVM (Ethereum, Polygon, BNB, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base), Sui, TON, and Ronin.

  Check it out now: [Historical Token Holders Chart by Token Address](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/token-holders-chart-token-address)

  ### [Pro-API Exclusive] New Endpoint  - Token OHLCV chart by Token Address

  This endpoint allows you to get the OHLCV chart (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) of a token based on the provided token address on a network.

  * This endpoint will return OHLCV data of the most liquid pool of the specified token. You may use this endpoint Top Pools by Token Address to check the top pools of a token.

  Check it out now: [Token OHLCV chart by Token Address](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/token-ohlcv-token-address#/)

  ### Improved Endpoints - Support Multi-pool Token Data

  Previously, we only surfaced 1 quote token for pools with more than 2 tokens.  With this new improvements, for pools that have 2 or more tokens:

  * Extra quote tokens being listed under a new key `relationships.quote_tokens`
  * If `include=quote_token` is flagged, the extra quote tokens will be also listed under `included`

  ```json
      "relationships": {  
        "base_token": {
          "data": {
            "id": "eth_0x40d16fc0246ad3160ccc09b8d0d3a2cd28ae6c2f",
            "type": "token"
          }
        },
        "quote_token": {
          "data": {
            "id": "eth_0x8353157092ed8be69a9df8f95af097bbf33cb2af",
            "type": "token"
          }
        },
        "quote_tokens": {
          "data": [
            {
              "id": "eth_0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48",
              "type": "token"
            },
            {
              "id": "eth_0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7",
              "type": "token"
            }
  ```

  This improvement is applicable to all onchain pool endpoints that support `relationships.quote_token`, including but not limited to:

  * [Top Pools by Token Address](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/top-pools-contract-address#/)
  * [Search Pools](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/search-pools#/)
  * [Megafilter for Pools](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/pools-megafilter#/)
  * [Trending Pools List](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/trending-pools-list#/)
  * [Specific Pool Data by Pool Address](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/pool-address#/)
  * [Top Pools by Network](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/top-pools-network#/)
  * [New Pools List](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/latest-pools-list#/)

</Update>

<Update label="May 2025">
  ## Upcoming Change Notice: Removal of normalized_volume_btc Data

  üóìÔ∏è **May 30, 2025**

  **Notice: Upcoming Change to CoinGecko API Endpoints - Removal of`normalized_volume_btc` Data**

  **Effective Date: 16 June 2025**

  **Affected Endpoints:**

  * [Exchange Data by ID](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/exchanges-id)
  * [Exchanges List with Data](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/exchanges#/)

  **Details of the Change:**

  Please be advised that the `normalized_volume_btc` data point will be removed from the above-listed API endpoints, effective 16 June 2025. This change is being implemented due to significant recent change to a 3rd party data source provider, which have fundamentally altered how this specific data can be accessed.

  Example of Affected Data Structure:

  ```json
    {
      "trade_volume_24h_btc_normalized": 47765.5886637453
    },
  ```

  After the effective date, the `trade_volume_24h_btc_normalized` field will no longer be present in the API responses for these endpoints.

  **Action Required:**

  If your applications or integrations currently rely on the `trade_volume_24h_btc_normalized` data from these CoinGecko API endpoints, please make the necessary adjustments to your code before 16 June 2025 to avoid potential errors or data discrepancies.

  ## New Endpoint & Improvements: On-Chain Trades, Net Buy Volume, and More

  üóìÔ∏è **May 29, 2025**

  ### [Pro-API Exclusive] New Endpoint  - On-chain Trades by Token Address

  Previously, the [Past 24 Hour Trades by Pool Address](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/pool-trades-contract-address) endpoint allows you to retrieve the last 300 trades of a specific pool only.

  With this new endpoint [Past 24 Hour Trades by Token Address](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/token-trades-contract-address), you can now retrieve the last 300 trades **across different pools**, based on the provided **token contract address** on a network.

  ### Improved Endpoints - Support Net Buy Volume Data

  The following endpoints now support more volume breakdown data:

  * [Specific Pool Data by Pool Address](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/pool-address)
  * [Multiple Pools Data by Pool Addresses](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/pools-addresses#/)

  By flagging `include_volume_breakdown=true` , you can surface the following data:

  * net_buy_volume_usd
  * buy_volume_usd
  * sell_volume_usd

  Sample Response:

  ```json JSON
  {
    "data": {
      "id": "eth_0x88e6a0c2ddd26feeb64f039a2c41296fcb3f5640",

<Update label="April 2025">
  ## New Endpoint & Improvements: On-Chain Trending Data, Enhanced Trending Search, and Improved Token Lookup

  üóìÔ∏è **April 25, 2025**

  ### [Pro-API Exclusive] New Endpoint  - On-chain Trending Search Data

  With this new endpoint [Trending Search Pools](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/trending-search-pools), you can now retrieve the on-chain trending search pools and tokens data, as seen on GeckoTerminal.com .

  By default, this endpoint returns the top 4 trending pools data, you may specify the `pools` parameter to retrieve up to top 10 pools data.

  Tips: you may flag `include=base_token` to retrieve the trending tokens data.

  Note:  this exclusive endpoint is available for our API [paid plan](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/pricing) subscribers (Analyst plan & above).

  ### [Pro-API Exclusive] Improved Endpoint - Trending Search List

  [Paid plan](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/pricing) subscribers (Analyst plan & above) can now use [Trending Search List](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/trending-search) endpoint and flag `show_max` parameter to retrieve more trending coins, NFTs and coin categories on CoinGecko.com.

  | Trending Data   | Public API (Demo plan) | Paid API (Analyst plan & above) |
  | :-------------- | :--------------------- | :------------------------------ |
  | Coins           | 15                     | 30                              |
  | NFTs            | 7                      | 10                              |
  | Coin Categories | 6                      | 10                              |

  ### Improved Endpoints - Support Token Lookup by Symbol and Name

  The following endpoints now support token lookup by symbol and name, in addition to the existing API ID support:

  * [Coin Price by IDs and Symbols](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/simple-price)
  * [Coins List with Market Data](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/coins-markets)

  Previously, these endpoints only supported token lookup by [API IDs]([https://docs.coingecko.com/docs/1-get-data-by-id-or-address#/methods-to-query-price--market-data-of-coins](https://docs.coingecko.com/docs/1-get-data-by-id-or-address#/methods-to-query-price--market-data-of-coins\)).  This enhancement streamlines token data retrieval and eliminates the need for manual coin ID mapping.

  Example Mapping:

  | API Ids  | Symbol | Name    |
  | :------- | :----- | :------ |
  | bitcoin  | btc    | Bitcoin |
  | tether   | usdt   | Tether  |
  | usd-coin | usdc   | USDC    |

  Lookup Priority: When multiple lookup parameters are provided, the system applies the following priority order: id (highest) > name > symbol (lowest).

  **Filtering by Symbol with`include_tokens`**

  The `include_tokens`parameter has been added to provide flexibility when filtering by symbol:

  * `include_tokens=top` : Returns only the top market cap token for the specified symbol.
  * `include_tokens=all`: Returns all tokens that share the specified symbol.

  Example Request & Data:

  | Request Example | Token Data Returned | Remarks |
  |:---|:---|:---|
  | pro-api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/markets?vs_currency=usd&symbols=btc&include_tokens=top | 1. Bitcoin | When symbols and 'include_tokens=**top**' is specified, only the top market cap tokens will be returned. |
  | pro-api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/markets?vs_currency=usd&symbols=btc&include_tokens=all | 1. Bitcoin<br/>2. Osmosis allBTC<br/>3. atcat<br/>4. Meld Bridged BTC (Meld)<br/>5. BlackrockTradingCurrency | When symbols and 'include_tokens=**all**' is specified, all the coins that share the same symbol will be returned.<br/><br/>All the 5 coins stated in the example have the same symbol 'btc'. |

  ### /coins/markets Endpoint Improvement

  We've enhanced the`/coins/markets` endpoint [Coins List with Market Data](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/coins-markets), by including 'total' and 'per-page' values in the Response Headers.

  This addition to the Response Headers enables developers to identify the total number of active coins on coingecko.com and specify the required pagination to retrieve all available data.

  ```Text Response Header (Example)
  per-page: 250
  total:16989
  ```

  ## Upcoming Change Notice: Removal of twitter_followers Data

  üóìÔ∏è **April 25, 2025**

  **Notice: Upcoming Change to CoinGecko API Endpoints - Removal of`twitter_followers` Data**

  **Effective Date: 15 May 2025**

  **Affected Endpoints:**

  * [Coin Data by ID](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/coins-id)
  * [Coin Data by Token Address](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/coins-contract-address)
  * [Coin Historical Data by ID](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/coins-id-history)

  **Details of the Change:**

  Please be advised that the `twitter_followers` data point within the `community_data` object will be removed from the above-listed API endpoints, effective 15 May 2025. This change is being implemented due to significant recent changes to the X (formerly Twitter) API, which have fundamentally altered how this specific data can be accessed.

  Example of Affected Data Structure:

  ```json
  "community_data": {  
    "twitter_followers": 7694251,
    // ... other community data points ...
  }
  ```

  After the effective date, the `twitter_followers` field will no longer be present in the API responses for these endpoints.

  **Action Required:**

  If your applications or integrations currently rely on the `twitter_followers` data from these CoinGecko API endpoints, please make the necessary adjustments to your code before 15 May 2025 to avoid potential errors or data discrepancies.

  **Important Note Regarding Previously Stored`twitter_followers` Data:**

  Please be aware that if you have previously stored `twitter_followers` data obtained from the CoinGecko API and archived it within your own systems, you are solely responsible for its continued use and any implications thereof.

  We appreciate your understanding as we adapt to changes in third-party platforms to maintain the stability and reliability of our API. If you have any questions or require further clarification, please do not hesitate to contact our support team.

  ### Onchain Simple Token Price endpoint - Market Cap to FDV Fallback

  The [Onchain Simple Token Price](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/onchain-simple-price) endpoint now supports fallback option for Market Cap to return FDV value, when the Market Cap value is not available. 

  Notes:

  * If the token's market cap is not verified by the CoinGecko team, the onchain endpoints will return **null** for its market cap value, even though it has a displayed value on GeckoTerminal, which might not be accurate as it often matches the Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV).
  * Market Cap can be verified by and sourced from CoinGecko, and the number may be higher than FDV as it may include Market Cap of tokens issued on other blockchain network.

  If you require the Market Cap key (`market_cap_usd`) to return FDV value (as seen on GeckoTerminal.com) when Market Cap data is unavailable, please specify this parameter `marketcap_fdv_fallback=true`.

     3. [Pools by Category ID](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/pools-category)

  **What This Means for You:**

  * **Fresher Data, Quicker**: With a reduced cache time, you'll now have the option to access more up-to-date data, closer to real-time!
  * **No Extra Credits for Cached Data**: If your request hits the cache (now updated every 30 seconds for endpoints above), there will be no additional credits charged‚Äîjust like before.

  **Things to Keep in Mind:**

  * If your request hits our origin server instead of the cache to retrieve the latest data, there may be additional credits used.
  * To balance cost and real-time data needs, we recommend reviewing your request frequency. For those who prefer to obtain data without extra credits, consider keeping your request interval at 60 seconds or more to align with the new cache duration.

  We're committed to continuously improving your experience and ensuring you get the data you need, as efficiently as possible. If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out to [soonaik@coingecko.com](mailto:soonaik@coingecko.com) .

  ## Update Frequency Improvements for selected Pro-API endpoints

  üóìÔ∏è **February 14, 2025**

  [Changes below are applicable to Analyst/Lite/Pro/Enterprise [plan subscribers](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/pricing) only.]

  Dear CoinGecko API paid plan subscribers, 

  We're excited to announce an improvement to our API, aimed at providing you with even faster access to real-time data! Starting **02:00 UTC, February 24, 2025**, the edge cache duration for the following endpoints will be reduced to 30s, allowing you to retrieve updated data more frequently.

  | Endpoints                                                                                                             | Effective Date & Time                                            | Current Update Frequency | New Update Frequency |

  **What This Means for You:**

  * **Fresher Data, Quicker**: With a reduced cache time, you'll now have the option to access more up-to-date data, closer to real-time!
  * **No Extra Credits for Cached Data**: If your request hits the cache (now updated every 30 seconds for endpoints above), there will be no additional credits charged‚Äîjust like before.

  **Things to Keep in Mind:**

  * If your request hits our origin server instead of the cache to retrieve the latest data, there may be additional credits used.
  * To balance cost and real-time data needs, we recommend reviewing your request frequency. For those who prefer to obtain data without extra credits, consider keeping your request interval at 60 seconds or more to align with the new cache duration.

  We're committed to continuously improving your experience and ensuring you get the data you need, as efficiently as possible. If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out to [soonaik@coingecko.com](mailto:soonaik@coingecko.com) .

  ## Enhanced Onchain Metadata, Increased Max Address Limit for Multi Endpoints, Improved Exchange Tickers Sorting

  üóìÔ∏è **February 09, 2025**

  ### Onchain Metadata: Improved Coverage

  **Previously:** Payload may return 'missing.png' for `image_url` for tokens that do not have image data.

  **Now:** Coverage of metadata (images, websites, description, socials) is now improved for tokens on Solana, Ton, Base, and Sui networks. For tokens that do not contain image data, 'null' value will be returned for `image_url`.

  **Improved endpoints with image data:**

  1. [Trending Pools List](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/trending-pools-list)
  2. [Trending Pools by Network](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/trending-pools-network)
  3. [Specific Pool Data by Pool Address](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/pool-address)
  4. [Multiple Pools Data by Pool Addresses](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/pools-addresses)
  5. [Top Pools by Network](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/top-pools-network)
  6. [Top Pools by Dex](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/top-pools-dex)
  7. [New Pools by Network](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/latest-pools-network)
  8. [New Pools List](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/latest-pools-list)
  9. [Search Pools](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/search-pools)
  10. [Top Pools by Token Address](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/top-pools-contract-address)
  11. [Token Data by Token Address](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/token-data-contract-address)
  12. [Tokens Data by Token Addresses](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/tokens-data-contract-addresses)
  13. [Token Info by Token Address](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/token-info-contract-address)
  14. [Pool Tokens Info by Pool Address](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/pool-token-info-contract-address)
  15. [Most Recently Updated Tokens List](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/tokens-info-recent-updated)

  **Improved endpoints with metadata (images, websites, description, socials):**

  1. [Token Info by Token Address](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/token-info-contract-address)
  2. [Pool Tokens Info by Pool Address](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/pool-token-info-contract-address)
  3. [Most Recently Updated Tokens List](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/tokens-info-recent-updated)

  Note: Metadata may be sourced on-chain and is not vetted by the CoinGecko team. If you wish to get metadata reviewed by CoinGecko team, you may use the following endpoints:

  * [Coin Data by ID](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/coins-id)
  * [Coin Data by Token Address](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/coins-contract-address)

  ### Improved Max Address Limit for onchain /multi endpoints

  **Previously:** Onchain /multi endpoints support up to 30 token or pool contract addresses per request. 

  **Now:** Onchain /multi endpoints support up to 50 token or pool contract addresses per request.

  **Improved endpoints:**

  1. [Tokens Data by Token Addresses](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/tokens-data-contract-addresses)
  2. [Multiple Pools Data by Pool Addresses ](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/pools-addresses)

  Note: this new max address input limit is exclusive for paid plan subscribers (Analyst plan & above) only.

  ### Improved Data Consistency for Exchange Tickers by ID

  For [Exchange Tickers by ID](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/exchanges-id-tickers) endpoint, the order is sorted by **trust_score_desc** by default. 

  * Sometimes duplicate or missing data may occur due to paginated cached response, especially when a ticker's rank changes between 2 paginated requests, e.g. it might shift from Page 2 to Page 1, vice versa.   
  * We've added a new `order` option: **base_target**, which will sort the tickers by **base** symbol, then **target** symbol, in lexicographical order, i.e. `0->9`, then `a->Z`.

  Example:  flagging ?order=base_target

  ```
  pro-api.coingecko.com/api/v3/exchanges/binance/tickers?order=base_target
  ```

  This sorting method ensures stable pagination, reducing issues where cached responses may cause duplicate or missing tickers across pages.

  7. [Top Pools by Network](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/top-pools-network)
  8. [Top Pools by Dex](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/top-pools-dex)

  ### Onchain Trades: Added Token Filter

  **Endpoint:** [Past 24 Hour Trades by Pool Address](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/pool-trades-contract-address)

  **Previously:** There was no way to filter trades data by base or quote token.

  **Now**: A new optional parameter has been added to allow filtering by base or quote token of a pool.

  * Parameter: `token`
  * Value options:
    * `base`
    * `quote`
    * `{token_address}`

  **Example**:

  ```json Example
  ?token=base // get the trades data of base token
  ?token=quote // get the trades data of quote token
  ?token=8FqXr6dw5NHA2TtwFeDz6q9p7y9uWyoEdZmpXqqUpump // get the trades data of specific token based on address
  ```

  ## Removal of Unsupported Categories

  üóìÔ∏è **January 23, 2025**

  ### Upcoming Removal of Unsupported Categories from CoinGecko and CoinGecko API

  #### Summary

  We are announcing the removal of certain categories from CoinGecko and CoinGecko API. These categories will no longer be supported across all API endpoints starting **February 12, 2025**.

  | No | Category Name          | Category ID         |
  | :- | :--------------------- | :------------------ |
  | 1  | US Election 2020       | us-election-2020    |
  | 2  | Governance             | governance          |
  | 3  | Cryptocurrency         | cryptocurrency      |
  | 4  | Technology and Science | technology-science  |
  | 5  | Presale Meme           | presale-meme-coins  |
  | 6  | Business Platform      | business-platform   |
  | 7  | Number                 | number              |
  | 8  | Structured Product     | structured-products |
  | 9  | Investment             | investment          |
  | 10 | Niftex Shards          | niftex-shards       |
  | 11 | Ethereum POW IOU       | ethereum-pow-iou    |
  | 12 | Mirrored Assets        | mirrored-assets     |
  | 13 | Remittance             | remittance          |
  | 14 | Protocol               | protocol            |
  | 15 | Unicly Ecosystem       | utokens             |
  | 16 | Finance and Banking    | finance-banking     |
  | 17 | Eth 2.0 Staking        | eth-2-0-staking     |

  #### Reason for Removal

  Many of these categories no longer have associated coins. Some categories are outdated and no longer relevant in the crypto space. The changes align with updated category topology standards to maintain data accuracy and relevance.

  #### Impact

  API responses for the `/coins/markets` [endpoint](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/coins-markets) will no longer support data of the categories above. Any requests specifying these categories will return an error.

  #### Action Required

  Ensure applications using the `/coins/markets` [endpoint](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/coins-markets) are not querying these removed categories. Please update any code or documentation referencing these categories to prevent errors.

  ## Extended Historical Data for Onchain OHLCV Endpoint

  üóìÔ∏è **January 15, 2025**

  ### What's New?

  We've improved the [Pool OHLCV Chart by Pool Address](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/pool-ohlcv-contract-address) endpoint to provide access to a much broader range of historical data.

  #### Key Updates

  * **Previous Behavior:** Users could only query data for the past 6 months from today.
  * **New Behavior**: Users can now access data from September 2021 to the present, depending on the pool's tracking start date on GeckoTerminal.
  * Each API request is **limited to a 6-month date range**, but users can query older data by using the before_timestamp parameter.

  Note: access to data beyond the past 6 months is only available to [Paid Plan](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/pricing) subscribers (Analyst plan & above).

  #### Action Required

  No changes are required for existing integrations. However, users who need data beyond the past 6 months should adjust their queries to use the `before_timestamp` parameter to fetch additional data.

<GreenSeparator />

  ## Update to Total Supply of POW Coins

  üóìÔ∏è **January 15, 2025**

  #### What's Changing?

  We are updating the definition of Total Supply for PoW (Proof-of-Work) coins to reflect the actual number of mined coins rather than the maximum supply. This change ensures consistency and accuracy in representing the supply data.

  #### Key Updates

  * **Previous Behavior:** 
    * Total Supply: Displayed as the maximum possible supply (e.g., Bitcoin: 21,000,000).
  * **New Behavior:**
    * Total Supply: Now reflects the actual number of mined coins.\
      For example: Bitcoin: \~19,500,000 (as of January 2025).

  This update will also affect historical Total Supply data for consistency. This change applies to all affected PoW coins, including Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Ethereum Classic, and more.

  #### Affected endpoints that contain "total_supply" data:

  * **Current Data**
    * [Coin Data by ID](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/coins-id)
    * [Coins List with Market Data](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/coins-markets)
  * **Historical Darta**
    * [Total Supply Chart by ID](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/coins-id-total-supply-chart)
    * [Total Supply chart within time range by ID](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/coins-id-total-supply-chart-range)

  #### Timeline:

  **Bitcoin:** Updated on Jan 14, 2025

</Update>

<Update label="December 2024">
  ## Added: Onchain Categories Data, CG data improvements

  üóìÔ∏è **December 24, 2024**

  ### NEW: Onchain Categories : Get Categories on GeckoTerminal.com

  This new [Categories List](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/categories-list) endpoint allows you to query all the categories supported on GeckoTerminal.com such as 'Pump Fun' and 'Animal'.  

  * This endpoint is exclusively available for [Analyst/Lite/Pro/Enterprise plan](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/pricing) subscribers only. 

  ### NEW: Onchain Catergory Pools: Get Pools of a specific Category

  This new [Pools by Category ID](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/pools-category) endpoint allows you to query all the pools of a specific category on GeckoTerminal.com.

  * This endpoint is exclusively available for [Analyst/Lite/Pro/Enterprise plan](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/pricing) subscribers only.
  * You can also obtain tokens of a specific category, by flagging `include=base_token` 

  ### Onchain Token Info: Added Categories Data

  You can now obtain the categories of a token via the following endpoints: 

  1. [Token Info by Token Address](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/token-info-contract-address)
  2. [Pool Tokens Info by Pool Address](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/pool-token-info-contract-address)

  Payload example:

  ```yaml json
    "categories": [
      "Doge",
      "Baby",
      "Animal"
    ],
    "gt_category_ids": [
      "doge",
      "baby",
      "animal"
  ```

  ### Onchain New Pools Data: Bug Fixed

  Previously, this [/networks/new_pools](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/latest-pools-network) endpoint omitted new pools that are created within the last 24 hours. 

  It now returns all newly created pools in the last 48 hours. 

  ### CoinGecko Exchange Data: Added support of inactive exchange id

  You now query the the list of id of delisted exchanges with [Exchanges List (ID Map)](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/exchanges-list) endpoint, by flagging `status=inactive `

  Payload example:

  ```yaml json
    {
      "id": "ftx",
      "name": "FTX (Derivatives)"
    },
    {
      "id": "ftx_spot",
      "name": "FTX"
    },
    {
      "id": "ftx_tr",
      "name": "FTX TR"
    },
    {
      "id": "ftx_us",
      "name": "FTX.US"
    },
  ```

  **Tips**: you may query to get historical volume delisted exchanges for via the following endpoints:

  * [Exchange Volume Chart by ID](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/exchanges-id-volume-chart) 
  * [Exchange Volume Chart within Time Range by ID](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/exchanges-id-volume-chart-range)

  ### CoinGecko Historical Chart Data: Faster Last UTC Day (00:00) Data Update

  For [Coin Historical Chart Data by ID](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/coins-id-market-chart) endpoint, the last completed UTC day (00:00) data is now available **10 minutes after midnight** on the next UTC day (00:10).

  Previously, the last completed UTC day (00:00) was only made available **35 minutes** after midnight.

  ## [Updated: Q4 2024] CoinGecko Asset Issuance Standardisation Initiative Updates

  üóìÔ∏è **December 17, 2024**

  As part of our commitment to improving data quality and enhancing the consistency of asset information, we are rolling out an asset standardization initiative at CoinGecko.

  **What is asset standardization?**\
  Standardization involves refining how we classify and display assets. By systematically organizing asset listings into more precise categories - such as native, bridged, or wrapped tokens each following specific naming conventions, we aim to eliminate confusion and enhance data reliability.

  **What changes should I expect?**\
  The most notable change is that non-native token contracts previously grouped under native asset listings will now be assigned their own distinct pages.

  For example, a bridged version of USDT that might have been aggregated under the original, native USDT page, will now be featured on a dedicated page specifically for that bridged variant.

  Additionally, there may be varying levels of changes in various aggregated data points of the standardized assets, including trading volume, supply, market cap rankings, etc., due to misplaced contracts being transitioned away from the original page to accurately reflect their true metrics.

  **Focus for Q3 2024** **[Completed ‚úÖ]**

  * [Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC)](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/wrapped-bitcoin)
  * [Wrapped Ethereum (WETH)](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/weth)
  * [Dai (DAI)](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dai)

  \*\*For full list of FAQs and updated infomation, please refer [here](https://support.coingecko.com/hc/en-us/articles/35555248857497-CoinGecko-Asset-Issuance-Standardisation-Initiative-Updates-and-FAQ)

  ### What's New in Q4 2024? üëà

  Building on Q3's achievements, we're expanding the scope of Standardization to include four additional Coins this quarter, selected based on their significance and impact on the DeFi ecosystem.

  * [Frax (FRAX)](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/frax)
  * [Wrapped AVAX (WAVAX)](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/wrapped-avax)
  * [Wrapped BNB (WBNB)](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/wbnb)
  * [Wrapped stETH (wstETH)](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/wrapped-steth)

  ### Tips and FAQs for API users

  #### **1. How does this affect my current API setup?**

  The following CoinGecko API endpoints will be impacted, with full details tracked in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15FyY1gvUi20LdnlJRly-pXvm5ATNbFbSy06VoI1vVs4/edit?usp=sharing). We encourage you to make the necessary adjustments and enable edit notifications on the Google Sheets, to receive real-time updates when non-native token contracts have been successfully standardized.

  **Simple**

  * /simple/price
  * /simple/token_price/{id}

  **Coins**

  * /coins/markets
  * /coins/{id}
  * /coins/{id}/tickers
  * /coins/{id}/history
  * /coins/{id}/market_chart
  * /coins/{id}/market_chart/range
  * /coins/{id}/ohlc
  * /coins/{id}/ohlc/range
  * /coins/{id}/circulating_supply_chart
  * /coins/{id}/circulating_supply_chart/range
  * /coins/{id}/total_supply_chart
  * /coins/{id}/total_supply_chart/range

  **Contract**

  * /coins/{id}/contract/{contract_address}
  * /coins/{id}/contract/{contract_address}/market_chart
  * /coins/{id}/contract/{contract_address}/market_chart/range

  **Exchange**

  * /exchanges/{id}/tickers
  * /exchanges/{id}/volume_chart
  * /exchanges/{id}/volume_chart/range

  #### **2. Do I have to make changes to my API?**

  **No changes are necessary** if you do not need data for non-native token contracts that will be separated away from the native tokens. 

  #### **3. What will happen to the coins that are separated into a new coin page?**

  Historical data for new non-native or bridged assets will only be available from the date of asset page creation (i.e. stnadardized). To access historical data prior to the asset standardization, we recommend retrieving data from the original native assets.

  #### **4. How do I identify the list of coins that will be separated?**

  For a finalised list of token contracts and API IDs that have been separated from its native asset page and listed individually, please refer to this [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15FyY1gvUi20LdnlJRly-pXvm5ATNbFbSy06VoI1vVs4/edit?usp=sharing)

  You may also identify the list of bridged coins via API: you may also use [/categories/list endpoint](/reference/coins-categories-list) to look for bridged categories such as:

  1. bridged-usdc
  2. bridged-wbtc
  3. bridged-weth

  Then you may use [/coins/market endpoint](/reference/coins-markets) to retrieve the list of coins

<Update label="March 2020">
  ## Improved /coins/{id}/tickers

  üóìÔ∏è **March 31, 2020**

  Starting from April 14th, 2020, there's a crucial update to the[ /coins/{id}/tickers](/reference/coins-id-tickers) API endpoint. Previously, the converted_last value represented the converted price per coin in USD. Now, it will accurately reflect the market price of the base currency itself.

  For example, if querying coins/tether/tickers, and there's a BTC/USDT ticker pair, the old converted_last might show 6491.51 USD. After the update, it will return 1, representing the actual market price of Tether.

  If you utilize converted_last for calculations, be aware of potential breaking changes and take necessary actions. If it's solely for display, no action is required, as this update ensures a more accurate representation of the intended value.

  **Example of responses:**

  ```json JSON
  {
    "name": "Tether",
    "tickers": [
     {
      "base": "BTC",
      "target": "USDT",
      ......
      "converted_last": {
        "btc": 0.00002336, //USDT price in BTC
        "eth": 0.00043493, // USDT price in ETH
        "usd": 0.99901 üëà //showing USDT price instead of Bitcoin Price
      },
      ......
      "coin_id": "bitcoin",

  ## Set default params value for tickers endpoints

  üóìÔ∏è **June 13, 2019**

  We've implemented an enhancement to the [/coins/{id}/tickers](/reference/coins-id-tickers) and [/exchanges/{id}/tickers ](/reference/exchanges-id-tickers) endpoints. 

  Now, users have the flexibility to use the optional `order` parameter, which defaults to trust_score_desc. 

  This addition allows users to customize the sorting order of tickers based on trust score, providing a more tailored experience for data retrieval.

  ## Included new fields

  üóìÔ∏è **June 10, 2019**

  We have introduced two new fields, last_traded_at and last_fetched_at, to the ticker data. 

  The existing timestamp field, which currently reflects the last_traded_at value, will be retained for compatibility. 

  However, please be advised that the timestamp field may be deprecated in the future. 

  We recommend updating your application to make use of the newly added last_traded_at and last_fetched_at fields for improved accuracy and compatibility.

  **Example of responses**:

  ## Introduced /exchanges/list endpoint

  üóìÔ∏è **January 24, 2019**

  We have introduced a new endpoint: [/exchanges/list](/reference/exchanges-list). 

  This addition expands the functionality of our API, allowing users to retrieve a list of available exchanges on CoinGecko with id and name easily.

<GreenSeparator />

  ## Set default params value for /coins/markets

  üóìÔ∏è **January 18, 2019**

  To minimize bandwidth usage, the [/coins/markets](/reference/coins-markets) endpoint will now automatically default to retrieving data for the top 100 coins by market cap when the 'ids' parameter is left blank. 

  This implies that the Order parameters will automatically default to `market_cap_desc`, ensuring a descending order based on market cap. The `Per_Page` parameters will default to 100, optimizing the response by providing data for the 100 results of coins per page if no coin's ids are mentioned.

  This enhancement aims to streamline the user experience while conserving bandwidth resources.

<Update label="December 2018">
  ## Reduced the usage of /coins (paginated) endpoint

  üóìÔ∏è **December 10, 2018**

  Recognizing the limitations of the paginated /coins feature, particularly its inability to query for specific coins, we have temporarily hidden it from the documentation to prevent confusion for new users. 

  Rest assured, there are no plans to remove or deprecate it in the near future. 

  Instead, we encourage you to transition to the more versatile [/coins/list](/reference/coins-list) and [coins/{id}](/reference/coins-id) options for a more tailored and efficient experience.
